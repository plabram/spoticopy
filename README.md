# Spoticopy

This project mimics a landing page for a major provider in the musin industry. It uses data from a mock API and contains different animations and interactive elements, bui√±t with JavaScipt, HTML, React and CSS.

Unit tests created in Vitest are available for the project. They're currently in `.gitignore`, but feel free to ask if you'd like to take a look!
